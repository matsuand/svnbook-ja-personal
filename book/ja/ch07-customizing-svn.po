"Version control can be a complex subject, as much art as science, that "
"offers myriad ways of getting stuff done.  Throughout this book, you've read "
"of the various Subversion command-line client subcommands and the options "
"that modify their behavior.  In this chapter, we'll look into still more "
"ways to customize the way Subversion works for you&mdash;setting up the "
"Subversion runtime configuration, using external helper applications, "
"Subversion's interaction with the operating system's configured locale, and "
"so on."

"Subversion provides many optional behaviors that the user can control.  Many "
"of these options are of the kind that a user would wish to apply to all "
"Subversion operations.  So, rather than forcing users to remember command-"
"line arguments for specifying these options and to use them for every "
"operation they perform, Subversion uses configuration files, segregated into "
"a Subversion configuration area."

"The interface between Subversion and external two- and three-way "
"differencing tools harkens back to a time when Subversion's only contextual "
"differencing capabilities were built around invocations of the GNU diffutils "
"toolchain, specifically the <command>diff</command> and <command>diff3</"
"command> utilities.  To get the kind of behavior Subversion needed, it "
"called these utilities with more than a handful of options and parameters, "
"most of which were quite specific to the utilities.  Some time later, "
"Subversion grew its own internal differencing library, and as a failover "
"mechanism, the <option>--diff-cmd</option> and <option>--diff3-cmd</option> "
"options were added to the Subversion command-line client so that users could "
"more easily indicate that they preferred to use the GNU diff and diff3 "
"utilities instead of the newfangled internal diff library.  If those options "
"were used, Subversion would simply ignore the internal diff library, and "
"fall back to running those external programs, lengthy argument lists and "
"all.  And that's where things remain today."
