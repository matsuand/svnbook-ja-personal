"      publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this\n"
"      License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource\n"
"      Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of\n"
"      the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or\n"
"      publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any\n"
"      terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this\n"
"      License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted\n"
"      hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact\n"
"      all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of\n"
"      warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly\n"
"      perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any\n"
"      technological measures that control access or use of the Work in\n"
"      a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License\n"
"      Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a\n"
"      Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work\n"
"      apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of\n"
"      this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from\n"
"      any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from\n"
"      the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the\n"
"      Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work,\n"
"      upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\n"
"      practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to\n"
"      such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.\n"

"      publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or\n"
"      Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for\n"
"      the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the\n"
"      medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or\n"
"      pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the\n"
"      title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably\n"
"      practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that\n"
"      Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such\n"
"      URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing\n"
"      information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work,\n"
"      a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work\n"
"      (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or\n"
"      \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). Such\n"
"      credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,\n"
"      however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective\n"
"      Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other\n"
"      comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as\n"
"      prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.\n"
"\n"
"5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n"

"OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n"
"DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED\n"
"WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n"
"\n"

"   APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY\n"
"   LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE\n"
"   OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE\n"

"   DAMAGES.\n"
