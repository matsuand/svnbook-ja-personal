"System (CVS) was the tool of choice for version control for many years.  And "
"rightly so.  CVS was open source software itself, and its nonrestrictive "
"modus operandi and support for networked operation allowed dozens of "
"geographically dispersed programmers to share their work.  It fit the "
"collaborative nature of the open source world very well.  CVS and its semi-"
"chaotic development model have since become cornerstones of open source "
"culture."

"<placeholder type=\"indexterm\" id=\"0\"/> <placeholder type=\"indexterm\" "
"id=\"1\"/>Much has changed since that time, though.  In the years since the "
"Subversion project began its life, a newer methodology of version control "
"called <firstterm>distributed version control</firstterm> has likewise "
"garnered widespread attention and adoption.  Tools such as Git (<ulink url="
"\"http://git-scm.com/\" />) and Mercurial (<ulink url=\"http://mercurial-scm."
"org/\" />) have risen to the tops of the distributed version control system "
"(DVCS)  ranks.  Distributed version control harnesses the growing ubiquity "
"of high-speed network connections and low storage costs to offer an approach "
"which differs from the centralized model in key ways.  First and most "
"obvious is the fact that there is no remote, central storehouse of versioned "
"data.  Rather, each user keeps and operates against very deep&mdash;"
"complete, in a sense&mdash;local version history data stores.  Collaboration "
"still occurs, but is accomplished by trading collections of changes made to "
"versioned items directly between users' local data stores, not via a "
"centralized master data store.  In fact, any semblance of a canonical "
"<quote>master</quote> source of a project's versioned data is by convention "
"only, a status imputed by the various collaborators on that project."

"There are pros and cons to each version control approach.  Perhaps the two "
"biggest benefits delivered by the DVCS tools are incredible performance for "
"day-to-day operations (because the primary data store is locally held) and "
"vastly better support for merging between branches (because merge algorithms "
"serve as the very core of how DVCSes work at all).  The downside is that "
"distributed version control is an inherently more complicated model, which "
"can present a non-negligible challenge to comfortable collaboration.  Also, "
"DVCS tools do what they do well in part because of a certain degree of "
"control withheld from the user which centalized systems freely offer&mdash;"
"the ability to implement path-based access control, the flexibility to "
"update or backdate individual versioned data items, etc.  Fortunately, many "
"wise organizations have discovered that this needn't be a religious debate, "
"and that Subversion and a DVCS tool such as Git can be used together "
"harmoniously within the organization, each serving the purposes best suited "

"In February 2000, they contacted Karl Fogel, the author of <citetitle>Open "
"Source Development with CVS</citetitle> (Coriolis, 1999), and asked if he'd "
"like to work on this new project.  Coincidentally, at the time Karl was "
"already discussing a design for a new version control system with his friend "
"Jim Blandy.  In 1995, the two had started Cyclic Software, a company "
"providing CVS support contracts, and although they later sold the business, "
"they still used CVS every day at their jobs.  Their frustration with CVS had "
"led Jim to think carefully about better ways to manage versioned data, and "
"he'd already come up with not only the Subversion name, but also the basic "
"design of the Subversion data store.  When CollabNet called, Karl "
"immediately agreed to work on the project, and Jim got his employer, Red Hat "
"Software, to essentially donate him to the project for an indefinite period "
"of time.  CollabNet hired Karl and Ben Collins-Sussman, and detailed design "
"work began in May 2000.  With the help of some well-placed prods from Brian "
"Behlendorf and Jason Robbins of CollabNet, and from Greg Stein (at the time "
"an independent developer active in the WebDAV/DeltaV specification process), "
"Subversion quickly attracted a community of active developers.  It turned "
